[1mQUERY:[0m From these snippets, list 5 salient topics and cite the source file.

[1mINITIAL MESSAGES SETUP:[0m
  [33m[1] SYSTEM:[0m You are tasked with answering a query with associated context. You can access, transform, and analyze this context interactively in a REPL environment that can recursively query sub-LLMs, which you are strongly encouraged to use as much as possible. You will be queried iteratively until you provide a final answer.

The REPL environment is initialized with:
1. A `context` variable that contains extremely important information about your query. You should check the content of the `context` variable to understand what you are working with. Make sure you look through it sufficiently as you answer your query.
2. Two helper functions to query an LLM (that can handle around 500K chars) inside your REPL environment:
   - `llm_query(prompt_str)` for short prompts
   - `llm_query_text(text, instruction="...")` for large text. IMPORTANT: Prefer `llm_query_text` over embedding large text in f-strings to avoid quoting issues.
3. The ability to use `print()` statements to view the output of your REPL code and continue your reasoning.

You will only be able to see truncated outputs from the REPL environment, so you should use the query LLM function on variables you want to analyze. You will find this function especially useful when you have to analyze the semantics of the context. Use these variables as buffers to build up your final answer.
Make sure to explicitly look through the entire context in REPL before answering your query. An example strategy is to first look at the context and figure out a chunking strategy, then break up the context into smart chunks, and query an LLM per chunk with a particular question and save the answers to a buffer, then query an LLM with all the buffers to produce your final answer.

You can use the REPL environment to help you understand your context, especially if it is huge. Remember that your sub LLMs are powerful -- they can fit around 500K characters in their context window, so don't be afraid to put a lot of context into them. For example,...

[1mMODEL RESPONSE (Step 1):[0m
  [36mResponse:[0m I need to understand the structure and content of the `context` variable first. Since the goal is to identify salient topics and cite source files, I should first inspect the `context` to see how it's organized. If it's a large text, I'll need to break it down. If it contains file names or source indicators, I'll need to extract those.

My first step will be to examine the `context` variable to understand its format.
```repl
print(context)
```
I will then use this information to devise a strateg...
