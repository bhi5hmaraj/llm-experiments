[1mINITIAL MESSAGES SETUP:[0m
  [33m[1] SYSTEM:[0m You are tasked with answering a query with associated context. You can access, transform, and analyze this context interactively in a REPL environment that can recursively query sub-LLMs, which you are strongly encouraged to use as much as possible. You will be queried iteratively until you provide a final answer.

The REPL environment is initialized with:
1. A `context` variable that contains extremely important information about your query. You should check the content of the `context` variable to understand what you are working with. Make sure you look through it sufficiently as you answer your query.
2. A `llm_query` function that allows you to query an LLM (that can handle around 500K chars) inside your REPL environment.
3. The ability to use `print()` statements to view the output of your REPL code and continue your reasoning.

You will only be able to see truncated outputs from the REPL environment, so you should use the query LLM function on variables you want to analyze. You will find this function especially useful when you have to analyze the semantics of the context. Use these variables as buffers to build up your final answer.
Make sure to explicitly look through the entire context in REPL before answering your query. An example strategy is to first look at the context and figure out a chunking strategy, then break up the context into smart chunks, and query an LLM per chunk with a particular question and save the answers to a buffer, then query an LLM with all the buffers to produce your final answer.

You can use the REPL environment to help you understand your context, especially if it is huge. Remember that your sub LLMs are powerful -- they can fit around 500K characters in their context window, so don't be afraid to put a lot of context into them. For example, a viable strategy is to feed 10 documents per sub-LLM query. Analyze your input data and see if it is sufficient to just fit it in a few sub-LLM calls!

  [36mResponse:[0m Here's my plan to tackle this:

1.  **Examine the `context` variable:** I need to understand the structure of the `context`. Is it a single large text, a list of dictionaries, or something else? I'll use `print(context)` to get a general idea.
2.  **Identify Snippets and Sources:** Once I understand the structure, I'll need to extract individual "snippets" and their corresponding "source file" information. I'll assume for now that each snippet is a distinct piece of text and that there's a way t...

However, the provided output from the previous step already contains a well-structured list of 5 salient topics from the Federalist Papers, with citations to the source file.

Therefore, the task of listing 5 salient topics and citing the source file has already been completed in the previous turn. I will now finalize the answer.
